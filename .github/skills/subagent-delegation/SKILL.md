# Subagent Delegation Patterns

## Skill Paths

- Workspace skills: `.github/skills/`
- Global skills: `C:/Users/LOQ/.copilot/skills/`

## Activation Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Creating repetitive code structures or boilerplate
- Performing data transformation tasks
- Analyzing codebase for patterns or information
- Generating documentation from existing code
- Creating simple utility functions
- Breaking down complex features into manageable subtasks

## Non-Activation Conditions

**Do NOT activate this skill when:**
- Task requires complex architectural decisions or critical security implementations
- User wants to learn how to implement the feature themselves
- Project documentation and context are insufficient for delegation
- Task is time-critical and delegation overhead would delay implementation
- User needs real-time collaboration rather than asynchronous delegation
- Core business logic or critical implementation paths are involved
- Task is too simple to warrant delegation overhead

## Core Delegation Patterns

See [Delegation Patterns](./references/patterns.md) for detailed examples of:
- Boilerplate generation (API routes, CRUD operations, component structures)
- Data transformations between formats
- File analysis and pattern extraction
- Documentation generation from code
- Utility function creation

## Integration Workflow

For delegating tasks to subagents, follow this 5-step process:

- **Step 1: Plan** - Analyze problem, design solution, identify routine subtasks
- **Step 2: Delegate** - Use `runSubagent` for routine or repetitive work
- **Step 3: Review** - Check output for correctness, completeness, integration compatibility
- **Step 4: Integrate** - Incorporate output into codebase, handle conflicts
- **Step 5: Validate** - Test integrated code, debug issues, ensure quality

## Quality Control

Before integrating subagent results, verify:
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (style, naming, structure)
- [ ] Matches specified interfaces and contracts
- [ ] Includes necessary error handling
- [ ] Has appropriate comments/documentation
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities or obvious performance issues
- [ ] Compatible with existing codebase (imports, dependencies)

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Over-delegation: Don't delegate critical security logic or core business rules
- ❌ Vague instructions: Always provide specific, actionable prompts
- ❌ No integration plan: Have clear plan for using subagent output
- ❌ Delegating planning: Never ask subagents to decide what to do

## Combining with Sequential Thinking

For complex tasks, use Sequential Thinking first to plan architecture, then delegate routine parts:

```javascript
// Use Sequential Thinking to plan
mcp_sequentialthi_sequentialthinking({
  thought: "Breaking down feature...identifying repetitive CRUD for delegation",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  totalThoughts: 5,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true
})

// Then delegate boilerplate
runSubagent({
  description: "Generate CRUD API",
  prompt: "Create CRUD functions matching data model..."
})

// Main agent implements core logic
```
