name: agent-task-mapping
description: Mapping tasks to specialized subagents (Code Explainer, UI Designer, Universal Janitor, Next.js Expert, React Expert, Playwright Tester, Tech Writer, etc.). Use when determining which agent to delegate to, reviewing agent capabilities, or finding appropriate specialist for specific tasks. Triggered by keywords like which agent to use, agent specialization, delegate to expert, specialized subagent, task delegation mapping.

# Agent Task Mapping

## Skill Paths

- Workspace skills: `.github/skills/`
- Global skills: `C:/Users/LOQ/.copilot/skills/`

## Activation Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Determining which specialized agent to delegate a task to
- Reviewing agent capabilities and expertise areas
- Trying to match a specific task to an appropriate specialist
- Needing quick reference for available agents and their purposes

## Non-Activation Conditions

**Do NOT activate this skill when:**
- Task is already in progress and delegation timing would disrupt workflow
- User wants to handle the task directly without delegation
- Task is trivial and would take less time to complete than to delegate
- There are no suitable agents available for the specific task
- User is asking for help with choosing a tool, not an agent
- Task requires real-time collaboration rather than asynchronous delegation

## Available Agents

See [Agent Details](./references/agent-details.md) for comprehensive information about each agent:
- Description and specialization areas
- When to use each agent
- Typical tasks handled by each

## Quick Reference

| Agent Name | Best For |
|------------|-----------|
| Code Explainer | Analyzing and documenting existing code |
| UI Designer | UI/UX improvements and design implementations |
| Universal Janitor | Code cleanup, simplification, and tech debt removal |
| Critical Thinking | Challenging assumptions and exploring alternatives |
| Next.js Expert | Next.js 15/16+ architecture and optimizations |
| Expert React Frontend Engineer | React 19+ patterns and best practices |
| Playwright Tester Mode | Comprehensive testing with exploratory testing |
| Tech Writer | Creating formal developer documentation |
| Create PRD Chat Mode | Generating Product Requirements Documents |
| Specification | Generating or updating specification documents |
| Plan | Research and outlining multi-step plans |

## Decision Framework

When choosing an agent for delegation:

1. **Identify task type**: Is it documentation, testing, code review, or development?
2. **Match to specialization**: Find agent whose description aligns with task
3. **Check availability**: Verify agent exists and has proper frontmatter configuration
4. **Use specific agentName**: Delegate using exact name from agent's frontmatter

## Task Categories

### Code Analysis & Documentation
- Use **Code Explainer** for analyzing existing code patterns
- Use **Tech Writer** for formal developer documentation
- Use **Specification** for generating feature specifications

### Code Quality & Maintenance
- Use **Universal Janitor** for cleanup and tech debt remediation
- Use **Critical Thinking** for challenging assumptions

### Development Work
- Use **Next.js Expert** for Next.js 15/16+ architecture and optimizations
- Use **Expert React Frontend Engineer** for React 19+ patterns

### Testing
- Use **Playwright Tester Mode** for comprehensive web application testing

### Planning & Requirements
- Use **Plan** for research and outlining multi-step plans
- Use **Create PRD Chat Mode** for generating Product Requirements Documents

### Design
- Use **UI Designer** for UI/UX improvements and design implementations
