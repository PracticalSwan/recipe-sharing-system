# Custom Agent Usage

## Skill Paths

- Workspace skills: `.github/skills/`
- Global skills: `C:/Users/LOQ/.copilot/skills/`

## Activation Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Discovering available custom agents in workspace
- Understanding .agent.md file structure and frontmatter
- Checking if an agent can be invoked as a subagent
- Learning which agentName to use for delegation
- Understanding agent tools and capabilities

## Non-Activation Conditions

**Do NOT activate this skill when:**
- Using purpose-built agents with clear documentation and usage patterns
- Task requires directly implementing solution rather than delegation
- Need to consult documentation about core agents (not custom agents)
- User wants to learn about built-in agents instead of custom ones
- Task is simple enough that delegation would add unnecessary complexity
- Working with agents that don't follow the .agent.md file structure

## Custom Agent Discovery

Custom agents are defined in `.agent.md` files in:
- System prompts directory: `~/.copilot/agents/` or similar
- Project repository: `.copilot/agents/` or `.github/copilot/agents/`

**To discover agents:**
1. Search for `.agent.md` files in the workspace
2. Read frontmatter of each agent file to understand capabilities

## Agent Frontmatter

Key frontmatter fields in `.agent.md`:

| Field | Purpose | Required? |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `name` | Display name used in `agentName` parameter | Recommended |
| `description` | What the agent specializes in | Recommended |
| `tools` | Tools available to the agent | Optional |
| `disable-model-invocation` | If false, agent can be invoked as subagent | Required |

## Invocability Check

**CRITICAL**: Only agents with `disable-model-invocation: false` in frontmatter can be invoked as subagents.

Check frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: "Code Explainer"
description: For analyzing and documenting existing code
disable-model-invocation: false  # Must be false for subagent delegation
tools: [Read, Search]
---
```

## Using Custom Agents

### Step 1: Discover Available Agents

Search for `.agent.md` files:
```bash
# Find agent files in project
find . -name "*.agent.md"

# Or in workspace directory
.search("*.agent.md")
```

### Step 2: Check Invocability

Verify `disable-model-invocation: false` is set.

### Step 3: Get Agent Name

Use the `name` field from frontmatter exactly as is.
- If frontmatter has `name` field value, use that value in quotes
- If name not specified, use filename without `.agent.md` or `.md` extension

### Step 4: Delegate Task

```javascript
runSubagent({
  agentName: "Playwright Tester Mode",  // Must match 'name' from frontmatter exactly
  description: "Test checkout flow",
  prompt: "Perform exploratory testing on the checkout flow: product selection → cart → payment confirmation. Generate comprehensive Playwright tests covering success scenarios, validation errors, edge cases (empty cart, payment failures), and accessibility."
})
```

## Workflow Example

```javascript
// Step 1: Main agent analyzes task and identifies need for testing
// "I need comprehensive testing for the checkout flow"

// Step 2: Discover custom testing agent
// Found: Playwright-Tester.agent.md with disable-model-invocation: false and name: "Playwright Tester Mode"

// Step 3: Delegate to custom agent
runSubagent({
  agentName: "Playwright Tester Mode",
  description: "Test checkout flow",
  prompt: "Perform exploratory testing on the checkout flow: product selection → cart → payment confirmation. Generate comprehensive Playwright tests covering success scenarios, validation errors, edge cases (empty cart, payment failures), and accessibility."
})

// Step 4: Review test output and integrate into test suite
```
