# Documentation Verification

## Skill Paths

- Workspace skills: `.github/skills/`
- Global skills: `C:/Users/LOQ/.copilot/skills/`

## Activation Conditions

Use this skill when:
- Reviewing documentation before merging
- Checking documentation completeness
- Validating code examples
- Ensuring no broken links
- Verifying configuration accuracy

## Non-Activation Conditions

**Do NOT activate this skill when:**
- Documentation exists only in design planning stages without implementation details
- User needs help planning documentation strategy rather than validating existing content
- Documentation verification needs to happen in a specific environment not currently accessible
- Task involves creating new documentation without existing content to verify
- User wants feedback on documentation approach rather than verification of technical accuracy
- Documentation verification requires domain expertise outside technical verification scope

## Before Applying Changes

**Check documentation completeness:**

1. All new public APIs are documented
2. Code examples compile and run
3. Links in documentation are valid
4. Configuration examples are accurate
5. Installation steps are current
6. README.md reflects current state

## Documentation Testing

See [Validation Procedures](./references/validation.md) for:
- Verifying code examples compile/run
- Checking for broken internal/external links
- Validating configuration examples against schemas
- Ensuring API examples match current implementation

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Example validation commands
npm run docs:check         # Verify docs build
npm run docs:test-examples # Test code examples
npm run docs:lint         # Check for issues
```
