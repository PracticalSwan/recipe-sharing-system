## Database Patterns

### Documentation Database Properties

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Title | Title | Document name |
| Status | Select | Draft / In Review / Published / Archived |
| Category | Select | API / Guide / Architecture / Runbook |
| Owner | Person | Document author/maintainer |
| Last Reviewed | Date | When last reviewed for accuracy |
| Tags | Multi-select | Technology, feature, or team tags |
| Priority | Select | High / Medium / Low |

### Project Tracker Database

| Property | Type | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Task | Title | Task description |
| Status | Select | Not Started / In Progress / Done / Blocked |
| Assignee | Person | Who is responsible |
| Sprint | Select | Current sprint/iteration |
| Due Date | Date | Deadline |
| Priority | Select | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 |
| Estimate | Number | Story points or hours |

## MCP Tool Workflows

### Creating a Knowledge Base
1. Use `Create a new Notion database` with documentation properties
2. Use `Create pages` to populate with initial documents
3. Use `Add a comment to a page` for review requests
4. Use `Get all comments of a page` to check review status

### Review Workflow
1. Author creates page with status "Draft"
2. Author adds comment tagging reviewer: "@Reviewer — ready for review"
3. Reviewer reads page and adds inline comments
4. Author addresses feedback, updates status to "Published"
5. Set "Last Reviewed" date

### Organizing Content
- Use database views (Table, Board, Calendar) for different perspectives
- Create linked databases for cross-referencing
- Use relation properties to connect related pages
- Tag consistently for filtering and search

---

## Best Practices

### Content Organization
- **One topic per page** — avoid mega-documents
- **Use headings** — H1 for title, H2 for sections, H3 for subsections
- **Link liberally** — connect related pages within Notion
- **Use callouts** — highlight warnings, tips, and important notes
- **Add a TOC** — for pages longer than 3 screens

### Maintenance
- Set quarterly review reminders for critical docs
- Archive outdated content instead of deleting
- Use "Last Reviewed" dates to identify stale pages
- Assign document owners for accountability

### Collaboration
- Use comments for async discussion and review
- Tag people in comments for notifications
- Create templates for recurring document types
- Establish naming conventions for consistency

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Page not found | Check page ID and permissions |
| Cannot create database | Verify integration has workspace access |
| Comments not appearing | Ensure comment permissions are enabled |
| Slow page loads | Reduce embedded content, split large pages |
| Permission denied | Check integration token scope and sharing settings |
