description: Design philosophy documentation and canvas-based visual creation for thoughtful, intentional design. Use when creating design philosophy documents, generating visual designs with canvas tools, articulating design principles, crafting multi-page design documents, or when asked to explore design thinking and aesthetic philosophy.

# Canvas Design

A two-step design workflow: first articulate a design philosophy, then create visual designs on canvas. Based on the [anthropics/skills canvas-design](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) approach.

## When to Use This Skill

- Creating design philosophy documents (.md)
- Generating visual canvas designs (.png/.pdf)
- Articulating design principles and aesthetic rationale
- Crafting multi-page design documents
- Exploring design thinking and intentional visual communication

## No-Activation Conditions

**Do NOT activate this skill when:**
- User asks general questions about design without visual creation tasks
- Request is for technical implementation without design philosophy
- Task doesn't involve design documentation or visual creation
- User wants to create code but not design systems
- Simple UI tweaks without design thinking

## Step 1: Design Philosophy Document

Create a markdown document that articulates the design philosophy before any visual creation.

### Philosophy Document Structure
```markdown
# Design Philosophy: [Project/Concept Name]

## Core Intent
What is this design trying to communicate? What feeling should it evoke?

## Guiding Principles
1. **[Principle Name]** — Explanation of how this shapes decisions
2. **[Principle Name]** — Explanation
3. **[Principle Name]** — Explanation

## Aesthetic Direction
- **Color Philosophy**: Why these colors, what they represent
- **Typography Philosophy**: What the type choices communicate
- **Spatial Philosophy**: How whitespace and layout serve the intent
- **Material/Texture**: Physical or digital texture decisions

## Inspirations & References
- [Reference 1]: What specifically resonates and why
- [Reference 2]: The element to borrow vs. what to avoid

## Anti-Patterns
- What this design explicitly avoids and why
```

### Philosophy Examples

**Minimalist App Design**:
> "Every element must earn its place. If removing something doesn't hurt the experience, it shouldn't exist. Whitespace is not empty — it's breathing room for the content that matters."

**Warm Community Platform**:
> "Design should feel like a well-lit kitchen — inviting, warm, organized but not sterile. Rounded corners, warm neutrals, and generous spacing signal 'you belong here.'"

**Technical Documentation**:
> "Clarity is kindness. Dense information needs generous hierarchy, consistent patterns, and visual anchors. The reader should never wonder where they are."

## Step 2: Canvas Creation

After establishing the philosophy, create visual designs that embody those principles.

### Canvas Workflow
1. **Review philosophy** — Reread the design philosophy document
2. **Define canvas** — Set dimensions, background, grid system
3. **Establish hierarchy** — Place primary elements first
4. **Apply philosophy** — Every decision references a stated principle
5. **Refine** — Remove anything that doesn't serve the core intent

### Essential Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intentionality** | Every element exists for a reason |
| **Hierarchy** | Guide the eye through deliberate contrast and spacing |
| **Consistency** | Repeated patterns build trust and comprehension |
| **Restraint** | Fewer elements, each carrying more weight |
| **Craftsmanship** | Pixel-perfect alignment, harmonious proportions |

### Multi-Page Documents
For multi-page designs:
- Maintain consistent margins and grid across pages
- Use a master color palette derived from the philosophy
- Create a visual rhythm — varying density to prevent monotony
- Include breathing pages (minimal content) between dense sections

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Every element traces back to a stated principle
- [ ] Color choices align with the documented philosophy
- [ ] Typography serves the content hierarchy
- [ ] Whitespace is intentional, not leftover
- [ ] The design could be explained purely through its philosophy doc
- [ ] Nothing decorative exists without purpose

## Craftsmanship Emphasis

Design is a craft. The difference between good and great design:

- **Alignment**: Not "close enough" but mathematically precise
- **Spacing**: Consistent rhythm using a base unit (4px, 8px)
- **Color**: Not just "looks nice" but optically balanced, accessible (WCAG AA+)
- **Typography**: Line height, letter spacing, and measure all tuned for readability
- **Details**: Transitions, hover states, focus indicators — the invisible work

> "The details are not the details. They make the design." — Charles Eames
