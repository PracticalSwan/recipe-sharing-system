Routing: HashRouter with layouts. AuthLayout wraps /login and /signup. RootLayout (protected) wraps /, /search, /recipes/create, /recipes/edit/:id, /recipes/:id, /profile, /users/:userId, /recipes/my-recipes (alias to Profile tab). AdminLayout guards /admin with nested routes: index -> AdminStats, /admin/users -> UserList, /admin/recipes -> AdminRecipes. RootLayout redirects non-authenticated to /login and admins to /admin. AdminLayout redirects non-admins to /login or /.
