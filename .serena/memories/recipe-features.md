Recipe UX: Home shows published recipes and search bar; updates on recipeUpdated/favoriteToggled. Search page uses URL params for keyword/category/difficulty/sort; multi-select categories; debounced history logging; uses RECIPE_CATEGORIES/DIFFICULTIES; sort by newest, rating (likes), or difficulty. RecipeDetail: view recipe, record views (user/guest), like/favorite toggles, reviews (1 per user) with delete, ingredient checklist, owner edit/delete; pending/suspended users can browse but can’t interact. CreateRecipe: create/edit with validation, multi-select categories (1–3), ingredients/instructions lists; new recipes set status pending; editing keeps status unless previously rejected then set to pending. Profile: view own or other user; tabs for recipes/favorites; edit profile modal with avatar selection; delete own recipes; respect pending/suspended restrictions.
