<a id="overview"></a>
## 🎯 Overview

The Recipe Sharing System is built to facilitate a community-driven platform where:
- **Guests (Pending Users)** - New registrations start with pending status; can browse and search recipes while awaiting admin approval
- **Contributors (Active Users)** - Approved users with full platform access; create and manage recipes, interact with content through likes/favorites/reviews
- **Admins** - Oversee the platform with user activation, recipe approval workflows, analytics, and content moderation

The system features a **comprehensive approval workflow** where:
1. New users register → Account created with "Pending" status
2. Admin reviews and activates user accounts
3. Contributors submit recipes → Admin approves before publication
4. Activity tracking and analytics provide insights into platform engagement

The system uses a **client-side storage approach** with localStorage, making it lightweight and suitable for demonstration and development purposes.

## 📊 System Diagrams

The project includes comprehensive visual documentation to help understand the system architecture, data flows, and relationships. These diagrams are available in two formats:

### Diagram Types

#### 1. **Application Flowchart**
Illustrates the complete user journey and application workflow, including authentication, role-based access, and feature interactions.

- **Location:** 
  - Mermaid: [mermaid-diagrams/application_flowchart_clean.mmd](mermaid-diagrams/application_flowchart_clean.mmd)
  - Graphviz: [python_diagrams/flowchart_graphviz.py](python_diagrams/flowchart_graphviz.py)
- **Shows:** User flows, decision points, authentication paths, admin workflows, contributor features, and guest limitations

#### 2. **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
Depicts how data moves through the system between users, processes, and storage.

- **Location:** 
  - Mermaid: [mermaid-diagrams/data-flow-from-py.mmd](mermaid-diagrams/data-flow-from-py.mmd)
  - Graphviz: [python_diagrams/data_flow_graphviz.py](python_diagrams/data_flow_graphviz.py)
- **Shows:** Data inputs/outputs, processing flows, localStorage interactions, authentication data flows, and recipe management pipelines

#### 3. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**
Visualizes the data model with entities, attributes, and relationships used in localStorage.

##### Conceptual ERD
- **Location:** [python_diagrams/er_recipe_conceptual_graphviz.py](python_diagrams/er_recipe_conceptual_graphviz.py)
- **Shows:** High-level entities (User, Recipe, Review, etc.) and their relationships without implementation details

##### Logical ERD
- **Location:** [python_diagrams/er_recipe_logical_graphviz.py](python_diagrams/er_recipe_logical_graphviz.py)
- **Shows:** Detailed data structure including all attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinalities

### How to Generate/View Diagrams

**Mermaid Diagrams (.mmd files):**
- Open in VS Code with Mermaid extension installed
- Preview using the Mermaid preview feature
- Render online at [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live)

**Graphviz Python Diagrams:**
1. Install Graphviz: 
   ```bash
   pip install graphviz
   ```
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python python_diagrams/<diagram_name>.py
   ```
3. Generated images are saved in `python_diagrams/out/` directory

These diagrams provide comprehensive documentation for understanding the system's architecture, data structures, and user workflows.

<a id="data-storage"></a>
## 💾 Data Storage

The application uses **browser localStorage** for data persistence:

### Stored Data
1. **User Accounts** - All registered user profiles and credentials
2. **Recipes** - All submitted recipes with their metadata
3. **Reviews & Ratings** - User feedback on recipes (enforces one per user per recipe)
4. **Session Data** - Current logged-in user information
5. **Search History** - User search queries with timestamps (query-only, no filters)
6. **Daily Stats** - Page views, active users per day
7. **Activity Logs** - Admin action history (user management, recipe approvals)

### Initial Data
The application comes with **comprehensive seed data** including:

**User Accounts:**
- 3 Admin accounts with different activity levels
- 7 User accounts spanning all statuses (Active, Inactive, Pending)
- Mix of Contributors and regular Users
- Pre-configured profiles with avatars, bios, and cooking levels

**Recipe Content:**
- 10+ diverse recipes across multiple categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Snack)
- Varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Different approval statuses (Published, Pending, Rejected) for testing workflows
- Complete recipe data including ingredients, instructions, prep/cook times, servings
- Recipe metadata: views, likes, favorites

**Engagement Data:**
- Pre-filled reviews and ratings from multiple users
- Sample favorites/bookmarks for user accounts
- View counts and like counts on recipes
- Historical daily stats for analytics dashboard

**Admin Data:**
- Recent activity log entries showing user management and recipe approvals
- Daily statistics for testing dashboard metrics
- Sample data spanning multiple days for trend analysis

This rich seed data allows you to immediately explore all features without creating accounts or recipes from scratch.

### Test Credentials

**Admin Accounts:**
| Email | Password | Name |
|-------|----------|------|
| `admin@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Admin User |
| `olivia@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Olivia Admin |
| `marcus@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Marcus Admin |

**Sample User Accounts:**
| Email | Password | Name | Role | Status |
|-------|----------|------|------|--------|
| `user@cookhub.com` | `user` | John Doe | User | Active/Inactive |
| `maria@cookhub.com` | `maria123` | Maria Garcia | User | Active/Inactive |
| `tom@cookhub.com` | `tom123` | Tom Baker | User | Suspended |
| `amy@cookhub.com` | `amy123` | Amy Wilson | User | Pending |
| `kevin@cookhub.com` | `kevin123` | Kevin Tran | User | Pending |
| `sarah@cookhub.com` | `sarah123` | Sarah Kim | User | Active/Inactive |
| `daniel@cookhub.com` | `daniel123` | Daniel Rivera | User | Active/Inactive |
| `lina@cookhub.com` | `lina123` | Lina Patel | User | Active/Inactive |
| `omar@cookhub.com` | `omar123` | Omar Hassan | User | Pending |

### Resetting Data

To reset all data to the initial seed state, open the browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```
Or use the storage utility:
```javascript
import { storage } from './src/lib/storage';
storage.resetData();
```
Or manually delete in the browser console -> Application -> Local storage
