## 🎯 Overview

The Recipe Sharing System is currently in two implementation phases:

1. **Current Release (localStorage):** A fully functional demonstration version with browser localStorage persistence, complete with user authentication, recipe management, reviews, admin dashboard, and all features listed below.

2. **Database Integration (In Progress):** A migration to a full-stack application with MySQL/MariaDB database and PHP RESTful API is being developed as part of CSX3006 Database Systems course. This will transform the application into a three-tier architecture (Presentation → Application → Data Layer).

Both versions are designed to facilitate a community-driven platform where:
- **Guests (Pending Users)** - New registrations start with pending status; can browse and search recipes while awaiting admin approval
- **Contributors (Active Users)** - Approved users with full platform access; create and manage recipes, interact with content through likes/favorites/reviews
- **Admins** - Oversee the platform with user activation, recipe approval workflows, analytics, and content moderation

The system features a **comprehensive approval workflow** where:
1. New users register → Account created with "Pending" status
2. Admin reviews and activates user accounts
3. Contributors submit recipes → Admin approves before publication
4. Activity tracking and analytics provide insights into platform engagement

The system currently uses a **client-side storage approach** with localStorage (demonstration mode), with a **full-stack database integration** in development to migrate to MySQL backend with PHP RESTful API.

<a id="data-storage"></a>
## 💾 Data Storage

### Current Storage: Browser localStorage

The application currently uses **browser localStorage** for data persistence:

**Stored Data:**
1. **User Accounts** - All registered user profiles and credentials
2. **Recipes** - All submitted recipes with their metadata
3. **Reviews & Ratings** - User feedback on recipes (enforces one per user per recipe)
4. **Session Data** - Current logged-in user information
5. **Search History** - User search queries with timestamps
6. **Daily Stats** - Page views, active users per day
7. **Activity Logs** - Admin action history (user management, recipe approvals)

### Database Integration (In Progress)

**Target Storage:** MySQL/MariaDB Database + PHP RESTful API

A comprehensive database backend is being developed as part of CSX3006 Database Systems course:

**Database Features:**
- **13 normalized tables** (3NF design) with proper constraints
- **2 views** for complex queries (recipe statistics, user dashboard)
- **5 stored procedures** for complex operations
- **6 triggers** for automatic logging and statistics updates
- **Complete seed data** matching current localStorage structure
- **Full RESTful API** in plain PHP with PDO
- **Session-based authentication** with HttpOnly cookies

**Database Tables:**
| Table | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `user` | User accounts with roles (admin/user) and status (active/inactive/pending/suspended) |
| `recipe` | Recipe metadata with status (published/pending/rejected) |
| `ingredient` | Recipe ingredients with quantity/unit |
| `instruction` | Step-by-step cooking instructions |
| `recipe_image` | Multiple images per recipe |
| `review` | Star ratings + comments (one per user per recipe) |
| `favorite` | Saved/bookmarked recipes |
| `like_record` | Recipe likes |
| `recipe_view` | View tracking (authenticated users) |
| `search_history` | Search query history |
| `daily_stat` | Daily aggregation (views, active users, new users) |
| `activity_log` | Admin action audit trail |
| `session` | Server-side session tokens |

**Progress:** View detailed implementation plan at [plan/upgrade-database-integration-1.md](plan/upgrade-database-integration-1.md) (62% complete — SQL scripts done, backend integration in progress)

### Initial Data
The application comes with **comprehensive seed data** including:

**User Accounts:**
- 3 Admin accounts with different activity levels
- 7 User accounts spanning all statuses (Active, Inactive, Pending)
- Mix of Contributors and regular Users
- Pre-configured profiles with avatars, bios, and cooking levels

**Recipe Content:**
- 10+ diverse recipes across multiple categories (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Snack)
- Varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Different approval statuses (Published, Pending, Rejected) for testing workflows
- Complete recipe data including ingredients, instructions, prep/cook times, servings
- Recipe metadata: views, likes, favorites

**Engagement Data:**
- Pre-filled reviews and ratings from multiple users
- Sample favorites/bookmarks for user accounts
- View counts and like counts on recipes
- Historical daily stats for analytics dashboard

**Admin Data:**
- Recent activity log entries showing user management and recipe approvals
- Daily statistics for testing dashboard metrics
- Sample data spanning multiple days for trend analysis

This rich seed data allows you to immediately explore all features without creating accounts or recipes from scratch.

### Test Credentials

**Admin Accounts:**
| Email | Password | Name |
|-------|----------|------|
| `admin@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Admin User |
| `olivia@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Olivia Admin |
| `marcus@cookhub.com` | `admin` | Marcus Admin |

**Sample User Accounts:**
| Email | Password | Name | Role | Status |
|-------|----------|------|------|--------|
| `user@cookhub.com` | `user` | John Doe | User | Active/Inactive |
| `maria@cookhub.com` | `maria123` | Maria Garcia | User | Active/Inactive |
| `tom@cookhub.com` | `tom123` | Tom Baker | User | Suspended |
| `amy@cookhub.com` | `amy123` | Amy Wilson | User | Pending |
| `kevin@cookhub.com` | `kevin123` | Kevin Tran | User | Pending |
| `sarah@cookhub.com` | `sarah123` | Sarah Kim | User | Active/Inactive |
| `daniel@cookhub.com` | `daniel123` | Daniel Rivera | User | Active/Inactive |
| `lina@cookhub.com` | `lina123` | Lina Patel | User | Active/Inactive |
| `omar@cookhub.com` | `omar123` | Omar Hassan | User | Pending |

**Note:** These credentials are for the localStorage version. The database version will create matching accounts during seeding.

### Resetting Data

To reset all data to the initial seed state, open the browser console and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```
Or use the storage utility:
```javascript
import { storage } from './src/lib/storage';
storage.resetData();
```
Or manually delete in the browser console -> Application -> Local storage
